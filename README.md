## Project Overview

The Car Accidents USA is a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) focused on understanding traffic accident patterns across the United States. Using a large dataset of accident records, this project investigates how factors such as weather conditions, road attributes etc influence the frequency and severity of accidents.

Our goal is to uncover meaningful insights through statistical analysis and visualizations that can support improved road-safety awareness and data-driven decision-making.

## Objectives

>Identify key accident patterns

Analyze when and where accidents occur most frequently (time of day, weekdays vs weekends, states, etc.).

>Understand severity factors

Examine which environmental or situational conditions correlate with higher accident severity.

>Clean & preprocess the dataset

Handle missing data, convert time formats, normalize fields, and prepare the dataset for analysis.

>Visualize trends with graphs and charts

Use plots, heatmaps, and distributions to clearly communicate insights.
